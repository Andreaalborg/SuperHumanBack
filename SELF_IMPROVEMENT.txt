- **Impact**: Better separation of concerns, easier testing, reusable logic

#### Modular Resolver Structure
- **Before**: All resolvers in single file
- **After**: Separate resolver files by domain (auth, ai, social, etc.)
- **Impact**: Better code organization, easier to maintain and extend

#### Configuration Management
- **Before**: Hardcoded values throughout code
- **After**: Centralized config files with environment variables
- **Impact**: Easier deployment, better security, configurable settings
