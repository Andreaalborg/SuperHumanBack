- [x] AI responses are no longer repetitive - OpenAI integration works!
- [ ] Need to switch from mock mode to real database mode for data persistence

## üìã TODO TASKS

### 1. Fix Mock Mode Issue
- [ ] Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- [ ] Verify database credentials in .env file
- [ ] Connect backend to real database
- [ ] Disable mock mode when database is available

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize GraphQL query performance
- [ ] Add database indexes for common queries

### 3. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add unit tests for all services
- [ ] Add integration tests for GraphQL resolvers
- [ ] Implement E2E testing framework
- [ ] Add API documentation

### 4. Future AI Enhancements
- [ ] Voice input integration (expo-speech)
- [ ] App control through AI commands
- [ ] Advanced personalization based on user patterns
- [ ] Predictive suggestions

## üö® KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Mock Mode Repetitive Responses** ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-06-13)
   - Cause: Backend running without database
   - Impact: ~~AI gives same responses repeatedly~~ FIXED with OpenAI integration
   - Solution: AI Coach now works perfectly with real OpenAI API

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Some users may need to manually set DB_PASSWORD
   - OPENAI_API_KEY needs to be added for AI features

3. **Port Conflicts**
   - Port 4000 may be in use on some systems
   - Need to kill existing processes or change port

## üìù NOTES

- All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved
- Authentication system is fully functional
- AI Coach works with both OpenAI API and fallback mode
- Frontend successfully integrates with all backend features
- Database schema is properly set up for all entities
- **2025-06-13 SUCCESS**: AI Coach now fully operational with real OpenAI responses
- **2025-06-13 SUCCESS**: Logout functionality completely fixed
- **2025-06-13 SUCCESS**: Backend runs successfully in mock mode with full AI features
