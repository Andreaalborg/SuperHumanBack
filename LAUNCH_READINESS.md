## üéØ Action Items for Launch

### Immediate (Today):
1. [ ] Confirm if frontend app exists separately
2. [ ] Setup PostgreSQL and test database connection
3. [ ] Document all API endpoints for frontend team

### This Week:
1. [ ] Deploy backend to staging environment
2. [ ] Create test user accounts
3. [ ] Setup basic monitoring/logging
4. [ ] Prepare onboarding documentation

### Before Launch:
1. [ ] Complete frontend-backend integration

3. [ ] Load testing with 20 concurrent users
4. [ ] Create user feedback collection system
5. [ ] Prepare support documentation

## üí° Recommendations

### For Fastest Launch (1 week):
1. **Assume frontend exists** - Focus on deployment
2. **Use Heroku** - Fastest deployment option
3. **Skip nice-to-haves** - Launch with core features only
4. **Manual onboarding** - Personal setup for first 15 users

### For Quality Launch (5-7 weeks):
1. **Build proper frontend** if missing
2. **Setup proper infrastructure** from start
3. **Include basic analytics** for learning
4. **Automated onboarding** flow

## üìà Success Metrics for Test Launch
